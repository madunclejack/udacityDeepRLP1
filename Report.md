# Project 1 Navigation using Double Deep Q-Network Implementation
The goal of this project was to design a Reinforcement Learning (RL) based agent that could navigate a closed space to collect yellow bananas while avoiding blue bananas. The environment is based on the Unity-ML Agents Banana Collector Environment. The agent for this project was originally a Deep Q-Network (DQN) model. However, the learning rate was unsatisfactory with DQN, so the agent was modified into a Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN) model which greatly reduced training time. Both models are discussed in Section 1. Section 2 discussed the hyperparameters available, and which values were chosen. Section 3 shows the resutls of training, and compares the DQN to the DDQN model. Section 4 contains the conclusion and recommendation for future work.

# I. Agent Architecture
The original (DQN) model was revolutionary because it was able to train and play Atari games with exceptional skill, as discussed in the paper [Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.5602). 
talk about DQN architecture, math equations, etc.
then talk about what things I added to original DQN to make this one (replay buffer, fixed q-targets)

The 
The agent is a (DDQN) implementation, which is an improvement on the original DQN model
